# Implementation of Sorting Algorithms
Sorting algorithms using java
Final Grade: A2

Includes:
1. Quicksort
2. Quicksort with insertion
3. Quicksort with median of 3 partitioning scheme
4. 3 way quicksort
5. Insertion Sort
6. MergeSort

There is also code to text the running time of each of the algorithms.

Also has an algorithm that generates pathological input sequences for median of 3 quicksort that will
require quadratic time to be sorted, assuming duplicates are not allowed
